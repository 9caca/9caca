## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="justify">
I am a financial professional transitioning into a career in data engineering. With over 10 years of experience in banking and financial services, I have a strong foundation in data analysis, financial reporting, and problem-solving. Currently, I am studying Python and SQL through Alura to build the technical skills needed for this new path.

During my time at Caixa EconÃ´mica Federal, I gained experience working with financial data and advising small businesses, which involved analyzing cash flows and interpreting financial statements. This cultivated my attention to detail, analytical thinking, and ability to collaborate with diverse stakeholdersâ€”skills that are invaluable in data engineering.

I am passionate about leveraging technology and data to create efficient, impactful solutions. My goal is to combine my expertise in financial services with new technical knowledge to contribute to data-driven decision-making and innovative projects.</p>
